# Simple Vector Framework for C++

Orriginally a vector framework wrote to be able to answer an interview-type question as part of a hiring process at a games company which required 2D vector manipulation like dot and cross products.

TODO: 
* Operator overloading so that simple aritmetic like scalar multiplication, addition and subtraction don't have to be functions called on Vector Objects.  
* Make base class Vector that Vector2 inherits from so that I can add...  
* Higher dimentional vectors Vector3 and Vector4, important for 3D maths or for colours. 
* More generalised Cross Product function to replace `VectorRotate()` to work with all supported diminsions of vectors. 
* Matrix classes
